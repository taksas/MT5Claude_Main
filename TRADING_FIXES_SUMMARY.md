# Trading System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Order Prevention
- Added `pending_orders` dictionary to track orders being processed
- Orders are marked as pending immediately before placement
- Prevents multiple identical orders for the same symbol

### 2. Conflicting Order Prevention  
- Added `symbol_positions` dictionary to track position types (BUY/SELL)
- System now checks for opposite positions before placing new orders
- Prevents simultaneous buy and sell orders for the same symbol

### 3. Stop-Loss Safety Improvements
- Fixed undefined `free_margin` variable bug in risk management
- Added minimum stop-loss distance of 0.2% (configurable)
- Added maximum stop-loss distance of 2% for risk control
- Improved margin safety calculations with leverage-aware position sizing
- Enhanced logging for stop-loss validation

## Configuration Changes
Added to `trading_config.py`:
- `MIN_SL_DISTANCE_PERCENT`: 0.002 (0.2% minimum)
- `MAX_SL_DISTANCE_PERCENT`: 0.02 (2% maximum)

## Key Code Changes

### engine_core.py

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run with demo account first
2. Monitor logs for:
   - "Pending order already exists" messages
   - "Opposite position already open" messages
   - Stop-loss validation messages
3. Verify:
   - No duplicate orders for same symbol
   - No simultaneous buy/sell for same symbol
   - Stop-losses are set at safe distances
   - No broker-forced liquidations

## Important Notes
- Position size is limited based on leverage (10-50% of free margin)
- Stop-loss must be between 0.2% and 2% from entry
- System tracks all pending orders and active positions
- Proper cleanup when positions close (by SL/TP or manual)
