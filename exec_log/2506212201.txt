I understand you want me to search for unique high-value trading symbols. Let me clarify a few things to help you better:

1. What type of trading symbols are you looking for? (stocks, crypto, forex, commodities?)
2. What do you mean by "install" - do you want to set up monitoring tools or add them to a trading platform?
3. Are you looking for symbols with specific characteristics (low volume, high volatility, emerging markets)?

I'll use multiple agent searches once I understand your specific needs.
