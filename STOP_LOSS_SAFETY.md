# Stop Loss Safety Features

## Overview
The live trading engine now implements a robust stop loss calculation algorithm that ensures every trade is protected with an appropriate stop loss level.

## Key Safety Features

### 1. **Multi-Method Stop Loss Calculation**
The system calculates stop loss using three different methods and selects the most appropriate one:

- **ATR-based**: Uses Average True Range (ATR) multiplied by 1.5 for dynamic volatility-based stops
- **Swing Points**: Uses recent price highs/lows (20-bar lookback) for support/resistance levels
- **Volatility-based**: Uses standard deviation of price changes for market-appropriate stops

### 2. **Safety Limits**
- **Minimum Stop Loss**: 5 pips (prevents stops that are too tight)
- **Maximum Stop Loss**: 20 pips (limits risk for scalping trades)
- **Risk/Reward Ratio**: Fixed at 1:1.5 for consistent profitability

### 3. **Automatic Verification**
- Stop loss is verified after order placement
- System automatically fixes missing or incorrect stop losses
- Continuous monitoring during trade lifetime

### 4. **Breakeven Protection**
- Moves stop loss to breakeven + 0.2 pips after:
  - 60 seconds in trade
  - $3+ profit achieved
- Protects profits and ensures risk-free trades

### 5. **Stop Loss Methods by Market Condition**

| Market Condition | Typical Method | Stop Loss Range |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Normal Market   | ATR or Swing   | 7-12 pips      |
| High Volatility | ATR (capped)   | 15-20 pips     |
| Low Volatility  | Minimum        | 5-7 pips       |
| Trending        | Mixed          | 5-15 pips      |

## Implementation Details

### Stop Loss Calculation Function
```python
def calculate_safe_stop_loss(symbol, signal_type, entry_price, market_data):
    # Returns: (stop_loss_price, take_profit_price, method_used)
    # Ensures stop loss is ALWAYS between 5-20 pips
```

### Order Placement
- Never places an order without verified stop loss
- Logs stop loss method used for each trade
- Double-checks stop loss is properly set

### Position Monitoring
- Checks every open position for proper stop loss
- Automatically corrects any missing stops
- Logs warnings for stop loss issues

## Trading Hours Restriction
- No trading between 3 AM - 8 AM (configurable)
- Avoids periods with wider spreads
- Protects against slippage in low liquidity

## Usage
The stop loss safety features are automatically applied to all trades. No manual configuration needed - the system will:

1. Calculate optimal stop loss before placing any order
2. Verify stop loss is set after order execution
3. Monitor and adjust stops during trade lifetime
4. Move to breakeven when appropriate

## Benefits
- **100% of trades have stop loss protection**
- **Consistent risk management**
- **Adaptive to market conditions**
- **Automatic safety verification**
- **Peace of mind for 24/7 operation**
